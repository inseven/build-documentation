## Certificate Requirements

It seems like macOS app (Catalist apps at the very least) require a separate Mac Installer certificate to sign the app on export.

## Updating Certificates

1. Create new certificates.
2. Re-generate profiles, download, and add to project--editing an expired profile will allow you to select a new certificate, save, and dowload.
